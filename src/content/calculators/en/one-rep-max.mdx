## Understanding Your One Rep Max (1RM)

The **One Rep Max (1RM)** is the maximum weight you can lift for a single repetition of an exercise. It's a fundamental metric in strength training used for program planning and progress tracking.

### Why is 1RM Important?

Knowing your 1RM helps with:
- **Training Programming** - Calculating the right weights for different rep ranges
- **Progress Tracking** - Measuring strength gains over time
- **Competition Preparation** - Preparing for powerlifting or weightlifting competitions
- **Safe Loading** - Avoiding overtraining through precise load calculation

### Formulas Used

Our calculator provides several proven 1RM formulas:
- **Epley Formula** - Most widely used, good for 1-10 reps
- **Brzycki Formula** - Accurate for lower rep ranges (1-7)
- **Lander Formula** - Conservative estimate
- **Lombardi Formula** - Good for higher rep ranges

You can estimate your 1RM without actually performing a maximum attempt, which is safer and reduces injury risk.
