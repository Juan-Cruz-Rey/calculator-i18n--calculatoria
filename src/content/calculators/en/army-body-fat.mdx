# Army Body Fat Calculator - Military Method

The Army Body Fat Calculator uses the official U.S. Army tape test method to estimate body fat percentage based on circumference measurements. This is the same formula used by the military to assess soldiers' compliance with Army Regulation 600-9 and the Army Body Composition Program (ABCP). Whether you're preparing for basic training, maintaining active duty standards, or simply curious about your body composition using military methods, this calculator provides accurate results based on official Department of Defense guidelines.

Unlike civilian methods that use calipers or expensive equipment, the Army's circumference-based method requires only a measuring tape and can be performed quickly in field conditions. This calculator is essential for service members, recruits, and anyone following military fitness standards.

## What is the Army Body Fat Method?

The Army Body Fat Method, also known as the "tape test" or circumference-based method, is the official body composition assessment technique used by the United States Army. Established under Army Regulation (AR) 600-9, this method estimates body fat percentage by measuring specific body circumferences rather than using calipers, underwater weighing, or expensive technology.

### Why the Army Uses This Method

The military developed this approach for several practical reasons:

**Field Practicality**: The method requires only a measuring tape, making it ideal for deployment scenarios, basic training environments, and remote locations where sophisticated equipment isn't available.

**Consistency**: When performed correctly, the tape test provides reproducible results across different evaluators and locations, ensuring fairness in personnel assessments.

**Cost-Effectiveness**: Unlike DEXA scans or bioelectrical impedance devices, the circumference method requires minimal investment while serving hundreds of thousands of service members.

**Time Efficiency**: A trained evaluator can complete a tape test in 2-3 minutes, allowing commanders to assess entire units efficiently during fitness evaluations.

### The Science Behind Circumference Measurements

The Army's formulas were developed through extensive research correlating body circumferences with body fat percentage determined by more precise methods. The measurements capture fat distribution patterns:

- **Neck circumference**: Represents lean mass and skeletal structure
- **Waist circumference**: Indicates abdominal adiposity, a key marker of total body fat
- **Hip circumference** (women only): Accounts for gender-specific fat distribution patterns

The formulas incorporate height to adjust for body size, creating equations that show strong correlation with hydrostatic weighing and DEXA scan results in military populations.

## U.S. Army Body Fat Standards

The Army maintains strict body fat standards that vary by age and gender. These standards are designed to ensure soldiers maintain the fitness levels required for military operations.

### Maximum Allowable Body Fat Percentage - Men

| Age Group | Maximum Body Fat |
|-----------|------------------|
| 17-20 years | 20% |
| 21-27 years | 22% |
| 28-39 years | 24% |
| 40+ years | 26% |

### Maximum Allowable Body Fat Percentage - Women

| Age Group | Maximum Body Fat |
|-----------|------------------|
| 17-20 years | 30% |
| 21-27 years | 32% |
| 28-39 years | 34% |
| 40+ years | 36% |

### Screening Table Weight

Before the tape test is administered, soldiers are first weighed and compared against height-weight screening tables. If a soldier meets the screening weight for their height and gender, no body fat assessment is required. The tape test is only administered when a soldier exceeds the screening weight.

**Important Note**: These standards apply to active duty soldiers. Reserve and National Guard components follow the same standards but may have different enforcement timelines. Special operations units may maintain more stringent requirements.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

Soldiers who exceed maximum body fat standards are:

1. **Enrolled in ABCP**: Entered into the Army Body Composition Program with mandatory monthly weigh-ins
2. **Given improvement timeline**: Typically have 90 days to show progress and 6 months to meet standards
3. **Flagged**: Prevented from promotions, schools, awards, and favorable personnel actions
4. **Subject to separation**: May be separated from service if unable to meet standards within the prescribed timeline

## How to Measure Correctly for the Army Tape Test

Accurate measurements are critical for fair body fat assessment. The Army has specific protocols that must be followed precisely.

### Equipment Needed

- **Measuring tape**: Non-elastic, fiberglass or steel tape preferred
- **Mirror or assistant**: To ensure tape is level and properly positioned
- **Flat surface**: For height measurement (if needed)

### Measurement Protocols

#### Neck Measurement (Men and Women)

1. **Positioning**: Stand upright with shoulders relaxed, looking straight ahead
2. **Placement**: Measure at the narrowest point below the larynx (Adam's apple) and above the collarbone
3. **Tape position**: Keep the tape perpendicular to the long axis of the neck
4. **Measurement**: Record to the nearest 0.5 inch or 0.5 cm
5. **Avoid**: Do not flex or extend the neck, maintain neutral position

**Common Mistakes**: Measuring too high (above Adam's apple), tilting the head up to appear slimmer, or placing tape at an angle.

#### Waist Measurement (Men)

1. **Positioning**: Stand with arms at sides, feet together, abdomen relaxed
2. **Placement**: Measure horizontally at the level of the navel (belly button)
3. **Breathing**: Take the measurement at the end of a normal breath
4. **Tape position**: Ensure the tape is parallel to the floor all around
5. **Measurement**: Record to the nearest 0.5 inch or 0.5 cm
6. **Avoid**: Do not suck in the abdomen or hold breath

**Common Mistakes**: Measuring below the navel, tensing abdominal muscles, or angling the tape downward in front.

#### Waist Measurement (Women)

1. **Positioning**: Stand naturally with arms at sides, feet together
2. **Placement**: Measure horizontally at the narrowest part of the torso (natural waist), typically above the navel and below the ribcage
3. **Breathing**: Measure at the end of a normal breath
4. **Tape position**: Keep the tape horizontal and level
5. **Measurement**: Record to the nearest 0.5 inch or 0.5 cm

#### Hip Measurement (Women Only)

1. **Positioning**: Stand with feet together, weight evenly distributed
2. **Placement**: Measure horizontally at the greatest protrusion of the buttocks
3. **Clothing**: Can be measured over light clothing; heavy clothing should be removed
4. **Tape position**: Ensure the tape is level all the way around
5. **Measurement**: Record to the nearest 0.5 inch or 0.5 cm

### Official Measurement Procedures

According to AR 600-9:

- **Multiple measurements**: Each circumference should be measured three times
- **Use middle value**: Discard highest and lowest, use the middle measurement
- **Different evaluators**: Having two trained evaluators improves accuracy
- **Privacy**: Measurements should be conducted in a private setting
- **Same-gender evaluator**: Preferably use a same-gender evaluator when possible

### Tips for Accurate Self-Measurement

If you're measuring yourself for preparation purposes:

1. **Morning measurement**: Measure at the same time of day, preferably morning after using the bathroom
2. **Minimal clothing**: Wear form-fitting clothing or measure directly on skin
3. **Use a mirror**: Check that the tape is level from all angles
4. **Don't cheat**: Accurate measurements help you track real progress
5. **Record everything**: Keep a log of all measurements to track trends

## Army Formulas vs. Civilian Methods

Understanding how the Army method compares to other body fat assessment techniques helps contextualize your results.

### Army Circumference Method

**Advantages**:
- No special equipment required
- Quick and field-deployable
- Consistent when performed correctly
- Cost-free after tape purchase
- Non-invasive

**Limitations**:
- Accuracy varies by individual body composition
- Can be affected by hydration status
- Doesn't distinguish between visceral and subcutaneous fat
- Standard error of ±3-4% in research studies
- Can disadvantage individuals with unusual body proportions

**Typical Accuracy**: ±3-4% compared to gold standard methods

### Skinfold Calipers

**How it works**: Measures subcutaneous fat thickness at specific body sites using calipers

**Advantages**:
- Relatively inexpensive
- Portable
- Can track changes in specific areas
- Well-researched equations available

**Limitations**:
- Requires trained technician
- User error significantly affects results
- Difficult to measure obese individuals
- Only measures subcutaneous fat (misses visceral fat)

**Typical Accuracy**: ±3-5% with experienced evaluator

### Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)

**How it works**: Sends a weak electrical current through the body; fat resists current more than lean tissue

**Advantages**:
- Quick and easy
- Widely available in gyms and home scales
- Non-invasive
- Provides additional metrics (water percentage, muscle mass estimates)

**Limitations**:
- Highly sensitive to hydration status
- Affected by food intake, exercise, and menstrual cycle
- Quality varies dramatically between devices
- Consumer models often inaccurate

**Typical Accuracy**: ±5-8% for quality devices; consumer models may be ±10%

### DEXA Scan (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry)

**How it works**: Uses low-dose X-rays to measure bone density, lean mass, and fat mass

**Advantages**:
- Highly accurate and reproducible
- Provides regional body composition data
- Shows visceral fat quantity
- Also measures bone density
- Considered a reference standard

**Limitations**:
- Expensive ($50-150 per scan)
- Requires medical facility or specialized center
- Not widely available
- Small radiation exposure (very minimal)

**Typical Accuracy**: ±1-2% (gold standard for body composition)

### Hydrostatic (Underwater) Weighing

**How it works**: Measures body density by weighing on land and underwater; fat is less dense than water

**Advantages**:
- Very accurate when performed correctly
- Well-validated method
- Minimal user error compared to calipers

**Limitations**:
- Requires specialized equipment and facility
- Uncomfortable for some individuals
- Requires complete air exhalation underwater
- Time-consuming
- Not widely available

**Typical Accuracy**: ±2-3% (reference standard)

### Which Method Should You Use?

**For Army compliance**: Use the official tape test method exclusively, as this is what will be used in official evaluations.

**For tracking progress**: The Army method works well if you maintain consistent measurement techniques. Track trends over time rather than focusing on absolute numbers.

**For most accurate assessment**: DEXA scans provide the best combination of accuracy, detail, and safety, though at higher cost.

**For regular monitoring**: BIA devices or the Army method offer good value for tracking changes, understanding their limitations.

## ABCP: Army Body Composition Program

The Army Body Composition Program (ABCP) is a comprehensive program designed to help soldiers who exceed body fat standards return to compliance while maintaining unit readiness.

### Entry into ABCP

Soldiers are flagged and entered into ABCP when they:

1. **Exceed screening weight** and subsequently fail the tape test
2. **Fail to make satisfactory progress** within required timelines
3. Are **identified by commanders** as having difficulty maintaining standards

### Program Requirements

**Monthly Weigh-ins**: Soldiers in ABCP must undergo monthly height and weight assessments.

**Progress Requirements**:
- **First weigh-in (30 days)**: Must show reasonable progress (typically 3-8 pounds or 1% body fat)
- **Subsequent weigh-ins**: Continued progress required every 30 days
- **Compliance deadline**: Must meet standards within 6 months of enrollment

**Nutrition and Exercise Counseling**: Soldiers receive guidance from nutritionists, physical therapists, or fitness professionals.

**Command Involvement**: Unit commanders must monitor and document soldier progress and participation.

### Consequences While in ABCP

**Flagging Actions**: Soldiers are flagged in personnel systems, which prevents:
- Promotions and advancement
- Attendance at military schools
- Receipt of awards and decorations
- Reenlistment or extension
- Favorable personnel actions

**Continued Service**: Despite the flag, soldiers remain on full duty status and must maintain all other Army standards including ACFT scores.

### Success in ABCP

To successfully exit the program, soldiers must:

1. **Meet body fat standards** for their age and gender
2. **Maintain standards** for 12 months after removal from ABCP
3. Demonstrate commitment to fitness and healthy lifestyle

### Separation from Service

Soldiers who fail to meet standards within the prescribed timeline may be separated from the Army. The separation authority considers:

- Overall service record
- Deployment history
- Medical conditions affecting body composition
- Level of effort and participation in ABCP
- Time in service and rank

**Important**: ABCP is designed to be rehabilitative, not punitive. The Army wants soldiers to succeed and provides resources to help them meet standards.

## ACFT Body Fat Exemption

The Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) introduced an important exemption to body fat requirements that recognizes overall physical fitness.

### The 540 Point Exemption

Under current Army policy, soldiers who score **540 points or higher** (out of 600) on the ACFT are **exempt from body fat standards** for that assessment period, even if they exceed screening weight or maximum body fat percentage.

### How the Exemption Works

**Automatic exemption**: Soldiers who achieve 540+ points are not required to undergo tape testing, regardless of weight.

**Incentivizes fitness**: This policy rewards soldiers who demonstrate exceptional physical capability across all fitness domains.

**Annual opportunity**: With annual or semi-annual ACFT testing, soldiers have regular chances to earn exemption.

**No ABCP entry**: High-performing soldiers won't be flagged or entered into ABCP based solely on body composition if they maintain 540+ scores.

### ACFT Scoring Breakdown

To achieve 540 points, soldiers need an average of 90 points per event across the six ACFT events:

1. **3 Repetition Maximum Deadlift (MDL)**: 90 points = 340 lbs (men), 230 lbs (women)
2. **Standing Power Throw (SPT)**: 90 points = 12.5 meters (men), 10.5 meters (women)
3. **Hand-Release Push-ups (HRP)**: 90 points = 70 reps (men), 50 reps (women)
4. **Sprint-Drag-Carry (SDC)**: 90 points = 1:33 (men), 1:57 (women)
5. **Plank (PLK)**: 90 points = 3:40 (all soldiers)
6. **2-Mile Run (2MR)**: 90 points = 13:30 (men), 15:30 (women)

### Strategic Considerations

**Strength over weight**: The exemption recognizes that muscular soldiers may weigh more but possess superior functional fitness.

**Mission readiness**: Physical capability matters more than arbitrary body composition standards for combat effectiveness.

**Motivation for excellence**: The 540-point threshold motivates soldiers to excel across all fitness domains rather than focusing solely on running or weight loss.

### Limitations of the Exemption

**Not a permanent solution**: Exemption only lasts until the next mandatory assessment; soldiers must maintain performance.

**Doesn't exempt from all standards**: Soldiers must still meet ACFT minimum standards and maintain professional military appearance.

**Commander's discretion**: Unit commanders may still require soldiers to maintain healthy body composition for special assignments or units.

**Health considerations**: High body fat combined with high ACFT scores may still indicate health risks that should be addressed.

## Interpreting Your Army Body Fat Results

Understanding what your tape test results mean helps you set realistic goals and maintain Army standards.

### Result Categories

**Well Below Standards (Men: &lt;18%, Women: &lt;26%)**:
- Indicates excellent body composition
- Provides buffer for seasonal weight fluctuations
- Suggests strong commitment to fitness
- May indicate very low body fat if combined with poor ACFT performance

**Within Standards (Men: 18-22%, Women: 26-32%)**:
- Acceptable for Army service
- Should maintain current habits
- Monitor for upward trends
- Focus on sustaining fitness

**Approaching Maximum (Men: 23-25%, Women: 33-35%)**:
- Warning zone requiring attention
- High risk of failing next assessment
- Implement immediate lifestyle changes
- Consider ABCP enrollment proactively with unit support

**Exceeding Standards (Men: >26%, Women: >36%)**:
- Non-compliant with AR 600-9
- Will result in ABCP enrollment
- Requires immediate action plan
- May affect career progression

### Factors Affecting Results

**Measurement Variability**: Different evaluators, time of day, hydration status, and clothing can cause 1-2% variations in results.

**Body Composition vs. Weight**: You can improve body fat percentage through muscle gain even without losing weight, as muscle is denser than fat.

**Regional Fat Distribution**: The Army formulas assume average fat distribution; individuals with unusual patterns (very lean legs but abdominal fat) may get less accurate results.

**Hydration Status**: Dehydration can slightly reduce circumference measurements, potentially improving tape test results artificially.

### Setting Realistic Goals

**Rate of change**: Healthy fat loss is typically 0.5-1% body fat per month with proper nutrition and exercise.

**Muscle preservation**: Extreme calorie restriction may cause rapid weight loss but also muscle loss, potentially worsening body composition long-term.

**Sustainable habits**: Focus on lifestyle changes you can maintain rather than crash diets or excessive training that lead to burnout.

**Professional guidance**: Work with Army nutritionists, physical therapists, and medical professionals for safe, effective progress.

## Limitations of the Tape Test

While the Army method is practical and standardized, it has important limitations that users should understand.

### Individual Variation

**Body proportions**: Individuals with short necks, long torsos, or unusual fat distribution patterns may receive inaccurate assessments.

**Muscle mass**: Very muscular individuals (bodybuilders, powerlifters) may have large circumferences despite low body fat, potentially causing false failures.

**Skeletal structure**: Wide-framed individuals may measure larger circumferences even at healthy body fat levels.

### Measurement Error

**Evaluator technique**: Different evaluators may measure slightly differently, causing 1-3% variations in calculated body fat.

**Tape placement**: Even small differences in where the tape is placed can significantly affect results.

**Subject positioning**: Posture, breathing, and muscle tension affect measurements.

**Equipment quality**: Stretched or non-standard measuring tapes can introduce systematic error.

### Physiological Factors

**Hydration**: Dehydration reduces circumferences slightly; overhydration increases them.

**Food intake**: Abdominal bloating from recent meals affects waist measurements.

**Time of day**: Circumferences tend to be smallest in the morning and increase throughout the day.

**Menstrual cycle**: Women may retain water during certain phases, affecting measurements.

### What the Test Doesn't Measure

**Visceral fat**: The dangerous fat around organs isn't directly measured.

**Muscle quality**: Doesn't distinguish between functional muscle and non-functional mass.

**Metabolic health**: Body fat percentage alone doesn't indicate cardiovascular fitness, insulin sensitivity, or other health markers.

**Fat distribution**: Doesn't identify whether fat is concentrated in high-risk areas (abdomen) or lower-risk areas (hips, thighs).

### Using Results Wisely

**Track trends**: Focus on changes over time using consistent measurement techniques rather than absolute numbers.

**Combine with other metrics**: Use ACFT scores, medical screenings, and how you feel/perform as additional indicators.

**Don't obsess**: Small variations are normal and expected; focus on long-term patterns.

**Verify concerning results**: If results seem inconsistent with your fitness level, request re-measurement or consider alternative assessment methods.

## How to Reduce Body Fat for Army Standards

Meeting Army body composition standards requires a combination of proper nutrition, effective exercise, and sustainable lifestyle habits.

### Nutrition Strategies

**Caloric Deficit**: To lose fat, you must consume fewer calories than you burn. A moderate deficit of 300-500 calories daily leads to sustainable fat loss of about 0.5-1 pound per week.

**Protein Priority**: Consume 0.7-1.0 grams of protein per pound of body weight to preserve muscle mass during fat loss. Good sources include chicken, fish, lean beef, eggs, Greek yogurt, and protein supplements.

**Whole Foods Focus**: Emphasize vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. These foods provide satiety and nutrients while supporting recovery from training.

**Hydration**: Drink adequate water (half your body weight in ounces as a baseline). Proper hydration supports metabolism, performance, and accurate body composition assessment.

**Limit Processed Foods**: Reduce intake of alcohol, sugary drinks, fast food, and highly processed snacks. These provide excess calories without satiety or nutritional value.

**Meal Timing**: While total calories matter most, eating protein-rich meals every 3-4 hours can help preserve muscle and control hunger during fat loss.

### Exercise Programming

**Strength Training**: Maintain or build muscle through resistance training 3-4 times per week. Focus on compound movements (squats, deadlifts, presses, rows) that build functional strength for ACFT performance.

**Cardiovascular Exercise**: Include 3-5 sessions of cardio weekly for calorie expenditure and cardiovascular health. Mix steady-state running (ACFT 2-mile preparation) with interval training for metabolic benefits.

**ACFT Preparation**: Train specifically for ACFT events to simultaneously improve body composition and test performance. This creates synergy between fitness and body fat goals.

**Recovery**: Include rest days and adequate sleep (7-9 hours nightly). Recovery is when adaptation occurs and supports hormonal balance for fat loss.

**Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase training volume and intensity to continue adapting. Stagnant training leads to plateaus in both performance and body composition.

### Army-Specific Considerations

**Unit PT Sessions**: Maximize these opportunities even if they seem easy. Additional movement contributes to daily calorie expenditure.

**Field Exercises**: View training events and deployments as opportunities to improve fitness rather than excuses to backslide.

**Dining Facility Choices**: When eating at DFACs, choose grilled proteins, vegetables, and whole grains. Skip fried foods, excessive desserts, and sugary drinks.

**Barracks Challenges**: If space or equipment is limited, use bodyweight exercises, running, and affordable equipment like resistance bands or adjustable dumbbells.

**Deployment Nutrition**: Maintain discipline even with MREs and limited fresh food. Focus on portion control and making the best available choices.

### Behavioral Strategies

**Track Progress**: Log measurements, body weight, and ACFT scores monthly to identify trends and adjust strategies.

**Accountability Partners**: Work with battle buddies pursuing similar goals for mutual support and motivation.

**Prepare for Setbacks**: Holiday periods, injuries, and high-stress situations will occur. Have strategies to minimize damage and return to healthy habits quickly.

**Professional Resources**: Utilize Army nutritionists, physical therapists, and Performance Triad programs available on most installations.

**Address Underlying Issues**: If stress, depression, or other mental health concerns contribute to poor eating or exercise habits, seek appropriate support through behavioral health services.

### Timeline Expectations

**First month**: Initial rapid weight loss (2-8 pounds) includes water weight; body fat may decrease 1-2%.

**Months 2-3**: Sustainable fat loss of 0.5-1% body fat monthly with proper adherence.

**Months 4-6**: Continued progress; most soldiers in ABCP should reach compliance within this timeframe with consistent effort.

**Long-term maintenance**: After reaching standards, maintain slightly stricter personal standards (2-3% below maximum) to provide buffer for normal fluctuations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How accurate is the Army tape test?

The Army tape test typically has an accuracy of ±3-4% compared to gold standard methods like DEXA scans or hydrostatic weighing. Accuracy improves significantly when measurements are taken by trained evaluators following proper protocols. The method works best for individuals with average body proportions and may be less accurate for those with unusual fat distribution patterns or very high muscle mass.

### Can I pass the tape test if I'm over the screening weight?

Yes, many soldiers exceed the screening weight but pass the tape test, especially those with significant muscle mass. The height-weight screening tables are intentionally conservative; the tape test provides a more nuanced assessment of body composition. Muscular athletes, bodybuilders, and strength-focused soldiers commonly fall into this category.

### How often is the Army tape test administered?

Active duty soldiers are typically assessed twice annually in conjunction with ACFT testing. Soldiers who exceed screening weight are taped at each assessment. Those enrolled in ABCP undergo monthly weigh-ins and tape tests until they meet standards. Unit commanders may also order assessments if they believe a soldier's appearance or weight affects unit readiness.

### What happens if I fail the Army body fat test?

Failing the tape test results in enrollment in the Army Body Composition Program (ABCP). You'll be flagged in personnel systems, preventing promotions, schools, awards, and reenlistment until you meet standards. You must undergo monthly assessments and show consistent progress. Soldiers who cannot meet standards within 6 months may be separated from service, though the Army considers individual circumstances and service records.

### Does muscle mass affect the Army tape test?

Yes, muscle mass affects measurements. Large neck circumference from muscle reduces calculated body fat percentage, which can help muscular individuals. However, very large waist circumference from abdominal muscle (in bodybuilders, for example) can increase calculated body fat. The formulas assume average body proportions, so extremely muscular individuals may get inaccurate results.

### Can women get inaccurate results due to hip measurements?

Women's results incorporate hip measurements to account for gender-specific fat distribution. While this generally improves accuracy for female body types, women with very large or very small hip-to-waist ratios compared to average may receive less accurate assessments. The formula assumes typical female fat distribution patterns; those with atypical patterns may see greater variation between tape test and other methods.

### What is a good body fat percentage for soldiers?

While maximum standards vary by age and gender, optimal body fat for military performance and health is generally 10-18% for men and 18-26% for women. This range provides adequate essential fat for health while maintaining lean mass for physical performance. Elite soldiers and special operations personnel often maintain lower percentages, though this requires significant dedication and may not be sustainable long-term for all individuals.

### How do I prepare for an official Army tape test?

To prepare: (1) Practice measurements using the same techniques evaluators will use, (2) Measure at the same time of day as official tests (usually morning), (3) Maintain consistent hydration and avoid excessive sodium the day before, (4) Wear minimal, form-fitting clothing during the test, (5) Know your rights - you can request re-measurement if you believe an error occurred, (6) Stay calm and maintain neutral posture during measurement. Avoid crash dieting or dehydration attempts, as these harm performance and health.

### Does the Army tape test differ for National Guard and Reserve?

The measurement technique and standards are identical for Active Duty, National Guard, and Reserve components - all follow AR 600-9. However, enforcement timing may differ slightly. Reserve and Guard soldiers are typically assessed annually or at required training events. ABCP enrollment and progression timelines follow the same structure, though the monthly assessment schedule may be adjusted for drilling status rather than active duty calendar.

### Can I use body fat percentage from other methods for Army compliance?

No, only the official circumference-based tape test is accepted for Army body composition assessment. Even if you have recent DEXA scan results showing compliance, you must pass the tape test to avoid ABCP enrollment. Other methods can be valuable for personal tracking and understanding your body composition, but they don't substitute for the official Army assessment method for personnel decisions.
