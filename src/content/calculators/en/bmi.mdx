## Understanding Your BMI Results

The **Body Mass Index (BMI)** is a universally recognized screening tool that helps assess whether you have a healthy weight for your height. It provides a quick snapshot of your weight status and potential health risks.

### Quick BMI Reference Guide

- **Below 18.5:** Underweight - May indicate malnutrition
- **18.5 - 24.9:** Normal weight - Healthy range
- **25.0 - 29.9:** Overweight - Increased health risk
- **30.0 and above:** Obesity - Significant health risk

## Why BMI Matters

Your BMI can indicate potential health risks. Research shows that people with BMI outside the normal range face higher risks of:

- Heart disease and stroke
- Type 2 diabetes
- High blood pressure
- Certain cancers
- Sleep apnea
- Osteoarthritis

## BMI Limitations

**Important:** BMI is a screening tool, not a diagnostic measure. It doesn't account for:

1. **Muscle mass** - Athletes may have high BMI despite low body fat
2. **Age** - Older adults may have more body fat at the same BMI
3. **Gender** - Women naturally have more body fat than men
4. **Ethnicity** - Different populations have varying health risks at the same BMI

### When BMI Isn't Enough

Consider additional measurements like:
- Waist circumference
- Body fat percentage
- Waist-to-hip ratio
- Overall fitness level

## Take Action for Better Health

### If Your BMI is High

- Consult with a healthcare provider
- Start with small, sustainable diet changes
- Aim for 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly
- Track your progress monthly

### If Your BMI is Low

- Rule out underlying health conditions
- Focus on nutrient-dense foods
- Consider strength training to build muscle
- Consult a nutritionist for a personalized plan
