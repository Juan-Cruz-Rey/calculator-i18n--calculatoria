**Leap Year Rules:**
1. Year divisible by 4 → Leap year
2. EXCEPT if divisible by 100 → Not a leap year
3. EXCEPT if divisible by 400 → Leap year

**Examples:**
- **2024:** Divisible by 4 → Leap year ✓
- **2000:** Divisible by 400 → Leap year ✓
- **1900:** Divisible by 100 but not 400 → Not a leap year ✗
- **2100:** Divisible by 100 but not 400 → Not a leap year ✗

### Recent and Upcoming Leap Years

**Recent:**
- 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024

**Upcoming:**
- 2028, 2032, 2036, 2040

### Impact on Date Calculations

Leap years affect calculations spanning February:

**Example: January 1 to March 1**
- **Non-leap year (2025):** 59 days
- **Leap year (2024):** 60 days

## Days in Each Month

### Standard (Non-Leap) Year

| Month | Days | Abbreviation |

## Date Arithmetic Examples

### Adding Days to a Date

**Example 1: Add 90 days to March 15, 2025**

March: 16 days remaining (31 - 15)
April: 30 days
May: 31 days
June: 13 days (16 + 30 + 31 + 13 = 90)

**Result:** June 13, 2025

**Example 2: Add 365 days to February 15, 2024 (leap year)**

**Result:** February 14, 2025 (not February 15 because 2024 has 366 days)

### Subtracting Days from a Date

**Example 1: Subtract 100 days from May 20, 2025**

May: 19 days (20 - 1)
April: 30 days
March: 31 days
February: 20 days (19 + 30 + 31 + 20 = 100)

**Result:** February 9, 2025

**Example 2: Subtract 30 days from January 15, 2025**

**Result:** December 16, 2024 (goes back to previous year)

### Calculating Age

**Example: Person born on July 15, 1985**

As of January 1, 2025:
- **Years:** 39
- **Months:** 5 (July to December = 5 full months)
- **Days:** 17 (from December 15 to January 1)
- **Total days:** 14,414 days

## Week Number Calculations

### ISO Week Dates

**ISO 8601 standard** defines week dates:
- Week 1: First week with a Thursday in the new year
- Weeks start on Monday
- Year can have 52 or 53 weeks

**Example: 2025 Week Numbers**
- January 1, 2025 (Wednesday) → Week 1
- January 6, 2025 (Monday) → Week 2

### Calendar Week vs ISO Week

**Calendar week:** Sunday to Saturday (US standard)
**ISO week:** Monday to Sunday (International standard)

**Differences can cause confusion** in international business contexts.

## Time Zone Considerations

### Date Line and Time Zones

When calculating dates across time zones:

**Example:**
- **New York (EST):** December 31, 2024, 11:00 PM
- **Los Angeles (PST):** December 31, 2024, 8:00 PM
- **London (GMT):** January 1, 2025, 4:00 AM
- **Sydney (AEDT):** January 1, 2025, 3:00 PM

**Impact:** Same moment in time, different dates!

### UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)

For consistent date calculations:
- Use UTC as baseline
- Convert local times to UTC
- Perform calculation
- Convert result back to local time

## Historical Calendar Changes

### Gregorian Calendar Adoption

The **Gregorian calendar** (current system) replaced the Julian calendar:

**Transition dates varied by country:**
- **Italy, Spain:** October 1582 (10 days skipped)
- **Great Britain, American colonies:** September 1752 (11 days skipped)
- **Russia:** February 1918 (13 days skipped)
- **Greece:** March 1924 (13 days skipped)

**Impact:** Historical date calculations before adoption are complex.

### Missing Days in History

When Britain adopted the Gregorian calendar:
- September 2, 1752 → September 14, 1752
- **September 3-13, 1752 never existed** in British colonies

## Practical Date Calculation Tips

### Avoiding Common Mistakes

1. **Exclusive vs Inclusive:**
   - "From Jan 1 to Jan 10" = 9 or 10 days?
   - Clarify if both endpoints count

2. **Month-end issues:**
   - Adding 1 month to January 31 = February 28/29 (not March 3)
   - Be aware of different month lengths

3. **Leap year awareness:**
   - Check for February 29 in range
   - 2000 was a leap year, 1900 was not

4. **Time zone confusion:**
   - Specify time zone for critical dates
   - Use UTC for unambiguous calculations

5. **Business day assumptions:**
   - Confirm which holidays apply
   - Clarify if "business days" or "calendar days"

### Quick Mental Calculations

**30-day months:** April, June, September, November
**31-day months:** January, March, May, July, August, October, December
**28/29-day month:** February

**Quick age check:**
- Has birthday passed this year? Age = Current year - Birth year
- Birthday not yet passed? Age = Current year - Birth year - 1

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many days are there between two dates?

Use a date calculator or manually count, accounting for different month lengths and leap years. Our calculator provides instant results for any date range.

### How do I calculate business days?

Count only Monday through Friday, excluding weekends and holidays. For a more accurate calculation, include specific federal or company holidays relevant to your context.

### What is the difference between calendar days and business days?

Calendar days include all days (weekends and holidays), while business days typically count only Monday-Friday, excluding holidays. "30 calendar days" = ~30 days. "30 business days" = ~42 calendar days.

### How do I add months to a date?

Adding months can be tricky due to varying month lengths. Generally, add the number of months and keep the same day. If the target month has fewer days (e.g., January 31 + 1 month), use the last day of the target month (February 28/29).

### Why do some years have 52 weeks and others 53?

A year has 365 days = 52 weeks + 1 day (or 52 weeks + 2 days in leap years). Depending on which day of the week January 1st falls, some years (especially leap years starting on Thursday) have 53 weeks in the ISO week date system.

### How accurate are date calculators?

Date calculators are extremely accurate for Gregorian calendar dates (from 1582 onward in most contexts). Historical dates before calendar reforms may require special consideration. Modern date calculators account for leap years automatically.

### What's the maximum date range I can calculate?

Most date calculators can handle dates from 1900 to 2100 or beyond. Practical limitations are minimal for everyday use. Historical dates may require specialized tools.

### Do date calculations work across different calendar systems?

This calculator uses the Gregorian calendar, the international standard. Other calendars (Hebrew, Islamic, Chinese) require specialized converters.
