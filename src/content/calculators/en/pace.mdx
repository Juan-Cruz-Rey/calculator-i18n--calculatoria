## Understanding Your Running Pace

The **Pace Calculator** helps runners calculate their pace (minutes per kilometer or mile), speed, and estimated finish time for various distances. This tool is essential for training planning and race strategy.

### Why Pace Calculation Matters

Knowing your pace is crucial for:
- **Race Strategy** - Planning your speed for even splits
- **Training Planning** - Setting the right intensity for different workouts
- **Time Prediction** - Estimating your finish time for upcoming races
- **Progress Tracking** - Monitoring improvements in your running performance

### Pace vs. Speed

**Pace** is expressed in minutes per kilometer (min/km) or minutes per mile (min/mi) and shows how long it takes you to cover a certain distance. **Speed** is measured in kilometers per hour (km/h) or miles per hour (mph) and shows how far you can run in one hour.

Our calculator converts between both formats and helps you better understand your running metrics.
