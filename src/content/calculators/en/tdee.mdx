# TDEE Calculator - Total Daily Energy Expenditure

Calculate your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) for free with our scientifically accurate calculator. TDEE is the total number of calories you burn each day, accounting for your basal metabolic rate and physical activity level. It's essential for properly planning your diet.

## What is TDEE?

**TDEE** (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) is the total amount of calories your body burns in a complete day. It includes:

- **BMR (60-75%):** Basal Metabolic Rate (calories burned at rest)
- **EAT (15-30%):** Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (planned exercise)
- **NEAT (15-20%):** Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (walking, standing)
- **TEF (~10%):** Thermic Effect of Food (digestion)

## How is TDEE Calculated?

TDEE is calculated by multiplying your **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)** by a **physical activity factor**:

**TDEE = BMR × Activity Factor**

### Physical Activity Factors

| Activity Level | Factor | Description |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| **Sedentary** | 1.2 | Little to no exercise, desk job |
| **Lightly Active** | 1.375 | Light exercise 1-3 days/week |
| **Moderately Active** | 1.55 | Moderate exercise 3-5 days/week |
| **Very Active** | 1.725 | Intense exercise 6-7 days/week |
| **Extremely Active** | 1.9 | Very intense daily exercise + physical job |

### Practical Example

If your BMR is 1600 kcal and you're moderately active:
- **TDEE = 1600 × 1.55 = 2480 kcal/day**

## How to Use Your TDEE for Your Goals

### For Weight Loss (Caloric Deficit)
Consume **15-25% less** than your TDEE:
- If TDEE = 2500 kcal → Eat 1875-2125 kcal/day
- Recommended loss: 1-2 lbs/week
- Don't go below your BMR

### For Muscle Gain (Caloric Surplus)
Consume **10-20% more** than your TDEE:
- If TDEE = 2500 kcal → Eat 2750-3000 kcal/day
- Recommended gain: 0.5-1 lb/week
- Combine with strength training

### For Weight Maintenance
Consume calories equivalent to your TDEE

## TDEE Components Explained

### 1. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
The largest component (60-75%). Calories you burn simply by being alive. Depends on:
- Age, gender, weight, height
- Body composition (more muscle = higher BMR)

### 2. Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)
~10% of TDEE. Energy used to digest:
- Protein: 20-30% of its calories
- Carbohydrates: 5-10%
- Fats: 0-3%

### 3. Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (EAT)
15-30% of TDEE. Planned exercise:
- Gym training
- Running, swimming, cycling
- Sports

### 4. Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)
15-20% of TDEE. Daily movement:
- Walking, taking stairs
- Housework
- Fidgeting, gesturing

## Differences by Gender and Age

### By Gender
- **Men:** Higher TDEE (more muscle mass)
- **Women:** 5-10% lower TDEE on average

### By Age
- **20-30 years:** Peak TDEE
- **Per decade:** Decreases ~2-3%
- **65+ years:** May reduce up to 20%

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between BMR and TDEE?
**BMR** is only resting expenditure. **TDEE** includes EVERYTHING: BMR + exercise + daily movement + digestion.

### Should I eat exactly my TDEE?
TDEE is an **estimate**. Adjust based on your results:
- If not losing weight → Reduce 100-200 kcal
- If losing too fast → Increase 100-200 kcal

### How often should I recalculate my TDEE?
Recalculate when:
- You change more than 10 lbs in weight
- You modify your exercise routine
- Every 2-3 months as a check

### Is TDEE accurate?
It has a margin of error of ±10-15%. Use it as a starting point and adjust based on your actual progress.

### Can I eat less than my BMR?
**Not recommended**. Can cause:
- Muscle mass loss
- Metabolic slowdown
- Fatigue, irritability
- Nutritional deficiencies

## Tips to Optimize Your TDEE

### To Increase Your TDEE
1. **Build muscle** (increases BMR)
2. **Increase NEAT** (more daily steps)
3. **Eat more protein** (higher TEF)
4. **Avoid extreme diets**

### To Track Your Real TDEE
1. Weigh yourself daily at the same time
2. Calculate weekly average
3. Adjust calories based on changes
4. Be patient (4-6 weeks to see trends)
