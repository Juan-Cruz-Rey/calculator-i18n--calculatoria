## Understanding Your Heart Rate Zones

The **Heart Rate Calculator** helps you determine your maximum heart rate (HRmax) and optimal training zones based on your age. This information is crucial for optimizing your workout intensity and achieving your fitness goals.

### Why Heart Rate Zones Matter

Training in the correct heart rate zones helps with:
- **Fat Burning** - Zone 2 (60-70% HRmax) is optimal for fat oxidation
- **Endurance Building** - Zone 3 (70-80% HRmax) improves cardiovascular fitness
- **Performance Enhancement** - Zone 4-5 (80-95% HRmax) boosts anaerobic capacity
- **Avoiding Overtraining** - Prevents excessive strain by monitoring intensity

### Calculating Maximum Heart Rate

Our calculator uses the proven formula: 220 minus your age for a general estimate. For more accurate results, you can also input your resting heart rate to get personalized training zones using the Karvonen method.
