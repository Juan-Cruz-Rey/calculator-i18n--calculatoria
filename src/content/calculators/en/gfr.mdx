## Understanding GFR Calculation

The **Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)** is a key indicator of kidney function. It measures how well your kidneys filter waste from your blood. The estimated GFR (eGFR) is calculated using your creatinine level, age, sex, and race.

### Why is GFR Important?

Monitoring GFR is crucial for:
- **Early Detection of Kidney Disease** - Identifying kidney problems before symptoms appear
- **Treatment Planning** - Adjusting medication dosages based on kidney function
- **Disease Progression** - Tracking the advancement of chronic kidney disease
- **Health Risk Assessment** - Evaluating risk for cardiovascular complications

### GFR Stages and Interpretation

Our calculator uses the CKD-EPI equation, which is considered the most accurate method for estimating GFR. Results are categorized into stages, from normal ({'>'} 90 ml/min/1.73m²) to kidney failure ({'<'} 15 ml/min/1.73m²).
