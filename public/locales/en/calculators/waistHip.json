    "description": "The waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is a measurement of body fat distribution. It is calculated by dividing waist circumference by hip circumference. A high WHR indicates more fat stored around the waist, which is associated with increased risk of health problems such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.",
