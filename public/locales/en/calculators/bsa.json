    "description": "Body Surface Area (BSA) is the measured or calculated surface area of a human body. It is used in many measurements in medicine, including drug dosing for chemotherapy, calculation of cardiac index, and more. There are different formulas to calculate BSA, with the most common being Du Bois, Mosteller, and Haycock.",
    "formulasTitle": "Formulas Used",
    "duboisTitle": "Du Bois Formula (1916)",
    "duboisFormula": "BSA (m²) = 0.007184 × height^0.725 × weight^0.425",
    "duboisDescription": "One of the oldest and most widely used formulas. Developed by D. Du Bois and E.F. Du Bois in 1916.",
    "mostellerTitle": "Mosteller Formula (1987)",
    "mostellerFormula": "BSA (m²) = √(height × weight / 3600)",
    "mostellerDescription": "The most commonly used formula due to its simplicity and accuracy. It is easier to calculate and is recommended for clinical use.",
