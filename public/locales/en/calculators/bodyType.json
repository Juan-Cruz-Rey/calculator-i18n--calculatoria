    "description": "Somatotypes or body types were developed by psychologist William Sheldon in the 1940s. This classification divides body types into three main categories based on skeletal structure and body composition.",

        "name": "Ectomorph",
        "description": "Ectomorphs have a lean body with long limbs, fast metabolism, and difficulty gaining weight or muscle mass. They typically have narrow shoulders and low body fat."
      },
      "mesomorph": {
        "name": "Mesomorph",
        "description": "Mesomorphs have a naturally athletic build with broad shoulders, narrow waist, and ease in gaining muscle. They have an efficient metabolism and respond well to training."

        "name": "Endomorph",
        "description": "Endomorphs have a larger bone structure, rounded body shape, and tendency to store fat. They have a slower metabolism and gain weight easily, but can also build muscle."
