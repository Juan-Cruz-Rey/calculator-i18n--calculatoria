    "title": "About BAC",
    "description": "Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) is a measure of alcohol concentration in your bloodstream. It's expressed as a percentage - for example, 0.08% means 0.08 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood.",
    "howItWorks": "How This Calculator Works",
    "formula": "This calculator uses the Widmark formula to estimate BAC based on alcohol consumed, body weight, gender, and time elapsed. The formula accounts for alcohol metabolism rate (approximately 0.015% BAC decrease per hour).",
