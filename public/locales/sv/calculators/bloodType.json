    "title": "Om Blod Typ Inheritance",
    "description": "Blod type is inherited from parents following Mendelian laws of genetics. Each parent contributes one allele (gene) that determines the child's ABO blood type and Rh factor.",
    "inheritanceTitle": "ABO Blod Typ Inheritance",
    "inheritanceDescription": "The ABO blood group system has four main types: A, B, AB, and O. Each person inherits one allele from each parent. Typ A can be AA or AO, type B can be BB or BO, type AB is AB, and type O is OO. A and B alleles are co-dominant, while O is recessive.",
    "rhTitle": "Rh Factor Inheritance",
    "rhDescription": "The Rh factor can be positive (+) or negative (-). Rh positive is dominant over Rh negative. A person with Rh+ can have genotypes ++ or +-, while Rh- can only be --. If at least one allele is +, the blood type will be positive.",
    "limitations": "This calculator provides probabilities baserat på standard genetic laws. Actual results may vary due to rare mutations or other genetic factors. Always consult with a medical professional to determine exact blood type."
