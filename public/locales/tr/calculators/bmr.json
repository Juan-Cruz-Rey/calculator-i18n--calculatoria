    "description": "Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the amount of energy (calories) your body needs to function while at complete rest. It represents approximately 60-75% of your total daily energy expenditure. This calculator uses three scientifically validated formulas to estimate your BMR.",

    "mifflinFormula": "Men: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age + 5\nWomen: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age - 161",
    "harrisFormula": "Men: BMR = 13.397 × weight(kg) + 4.799 × height(cm) - 5.677 × age + 88.362\nWomen: BMR = 9.247 × weight(kg) + 3.098 × height(cm) - 4.330 × age + 447.593",
