    "title": "About the TDEE Calculator",
    "description": "Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) represents the total number of calories your body burns in a day, including your basal metabolic rate (BMR) and calories burned through physical activity. This calculator uses the Mifflin-St Jeor equation to calculate your BMR and multiplies it by your activity level.",
    "formulasTitle": "Formulas Used",
    "mifflinFormula": "Men: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age + 5\nWomen: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age - 161\nTDEE = BMR × Activity Factor",
